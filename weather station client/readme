This source code is part of low cost weather station, based on the Adafruit feather that communicates with any LoRa intermediate gateway node. With expert level architecture, the challenge here is integrate a set of feedbacks available to IOT cloud connectivity too post-processing received data, whose transmission is carried out from LoRa bi-directional communication as part of an infrastructure and low cost technology, with the challenge of representing a low cost technologic long range communication, developing a light and scalable platform with low or zero energy resources.

Below you can see a step-by-step tutorial, a simple user guide, how to use this source code to work with your weather station:
