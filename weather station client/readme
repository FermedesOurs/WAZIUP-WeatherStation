This source code is part of low cost weather station, based on the Adafruit feather that communicates with any LoRa intermediate gateway node. With same expert level architecture, the challenge here is integrate a set of feedbacks available to IOT cloud connectivity to collect data and send them to gateway like a post-processing received data, whose transmission is carried out from LoRa bi-directional communication as part of an infrastructure and low cost technology, with the challenge of representing a low cost technologic long range communication, developing a light and scalable platform with low or zero energy resources.

GETTING, COMPILING AND INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE
Below you can see a step-by-step tutorial, a simple user guide, about how to use this source code to work with your weather station:

We use this hardware list:- Adafruit Feather 32u4 RFM95 LoRa Radio with female pin headers (Product page: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3078)- Sparkfun Weather Shield with RJ11 female connectors (Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12081)- Wind and rain sensors kit (Product page: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8942)- Antenna 868 Mhz and SMA cable

First of all you need to assembling the hardware, and then programming the software and tested it. To assemble the hardware we recommend first reading the document provided by Unparallel inovation, and then just follow the next steps:
- Download the arduino IDE 1.6.6 or late.
- Download the lib folder that has all the libraries you will need it. The featherLib library includes LoRa Communication and was builted because of feather specification. The weatherConfig library includes all necessary sensor control functions. For these libraries you will need to install by 'add .ZIP Library …’ in arduino IDE.- We recommend to use the feather_LoRa_WeatherStation.ino script. It contains the stable version for Feather board, a sample to use the sensores and output data with Lora communication. You can use this sketch as is.
- For next default configuration we show what it is possible to change. Other types of default configuration, like I/O pins or other defines, steels like the way it is.

- Serial monitor: You can see the sensors output and LoRa communication state if you use serial communication. Be sure to use 38400 bauds

SYSTEM RUNNING1.	Power-on the Feather. The script starts automatically when feather is powered on.2.	At the start and during its automatic sensors calibration process the GREEN leD is on (take about 5 seconds). 3.	Wakes-up every 4 min, take all the measurements and send to GW.4.	At the moment of reading values of the sensors and sending a message to the LoRa gateway the blue led lights up and then:	I.	If feather does not receive acknowledge then the blue led turns off and Feather sleeps. 	II.	If feather receive acknowledge from master gateway then the blue led switch to green for 2 seconds, and feathers start sleeping.5.	When Feather sleeps all led’s are off.6.	Feather wake up after four minute (by default), take the measurements and send back to master gateway until sleeping again.

TEST WITHOUT LOWPOWER-	Sketch “feather_Lora_WeatherStation.ino”-	With radio LoRa Sleep mode policy-	Without feather low-power policy -	Wake-up’s 4 minutes at a time-	+14 dbm of power-	10 mA with radio in sleep mode-	115 mA when is active and sending-	20 mA when waiting for ACK-	10 mA average
-	Note, again, that in this case we did not realize any advanced power saving mechanisms such as putting the micro-controller in deep sleep mode or lower frequency, or 		performing ADC reduction, just powering off the radio module using your sleep mode. It is expected that the baseline consumption can be further decreased with more 		advanced power management policy. -	Can running for 1 week with four batteries 2600 mAh with this specification

TEST WITH LOWPOWER-	Sketchs “feather_Lora_WeatherStation_lowpower.ino”-	With radio LoRa Sleep mode policy-	With feather low-power policy -	Wake-up’s 4 minutes at a time-	+14 dbm of power-	1 mA with radio in sleep mode and feather too-	120 mA when is active and sending-	20 mA when waiting for ACK-	1 mA average
-	After removing the energy consumed by the feather, we found that an entire cycle for data acquisition, encoding and transmission consumes about 120 mA.-	The largest consumed energy part on the system comes from weather shield (about 80% of then). The receiving communication actually consumes less than half that amount 		of energy.-	Can running for 10 weeks with four batteries AA 2600 mAh with this specification
-	In this case, the sleeping intervals are not being respected, this is because the relationship between the sensor interrupts and lowPower has not yet been resolved, and 	the whole system wakes up at the moment an interrupt occurs.
