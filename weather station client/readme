Low-Cost Weather station with Lora Communication




This document aims to synthesize the design of a low cost weather station, based on the Adafruit feather that communicates with any LoRa intermediate gateway node. It describes the creation of a vigilant weather supervision, composed by multi-tech sensors to being part of the IOT station with LoRa network integration.

With expert level architecture, the challenge here is integrate a set of feedbacks available to IOT cloud connectivity too post-processing received data, whose transmission is carried out from LoRa bi-directional communication as part of an infrastructure and low cost technology, with the challenge of representing a low cost technologic long range communication, developing a light and scalable platform with low or zero energy resources.

Nowadays there are many advanced and well-integrated weather station. Part of this is developing an IoT solution that could be qualified as "low-cost" built with LoRa radio. In order to decrease costs, we improve this project with cheap devices, radios and LoRa Gateways, who satisfy small to medium size deployment scenario application cases.
