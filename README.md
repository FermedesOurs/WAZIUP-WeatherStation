# Weather Station for WAZIUP project - by UNPARALLEL Innovation, Lda

This repository aims to provide all information related to the WAZIUP Weather Station, based on the Adafruit Feather board. 
This board communicates with any LoRa intermediate gateway node. It describes the creation of a vigilant weather supervision, composed by multi-tech sensors as part of the IoT sensor node with LoRa network integration. This work was done in the context of WAZIUP Research Project, which has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s H2020 Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No 687607.

Within this git, you'll find two different folders:

  - WAZIUP Gateway Modifications: This folder contains the scripts created so that the WAZIUP LoRa Gateway can connect to the Cloud repositoires, such as the actual WAZIUP Platform, and a ThingsSpeak channel created for this Weather data.
  - WAZIUP Weather Station Client: This folder contains all the source code and documentation needed to deploy a fully working WAZIUP Weather Station.
  
  
Here you can also find a document with filename "MVP_LowCost_Weather_Station.pdf", with a guide on how to use the contents within this repository to be able to deploy a WAZIUP Weather Station, and enable it to communicate with the WAZIUP LoRa Gateway.
