Arduino example sketches
========================

This folder contains sketches for Arduino (and compatible) boards used in the WAZIUP Weather Station tests. 


**Arduino_LoRa_Ping_Pong** shows a simple ping-pong communication between a LoRa device and a gateway by requesting an acknowlegment for data messages sent to the gateway. (*1)

**Arduino_LoRa_Gateway** shows how to receive and send data. (*1)

**Weather_Shield_Basic** This example prints the current humidity, air pressure, temperature and light levels. The weather shield is capable of a lot. Be sure to checkout the other more advanced examples for creating your own weather station. (*2)

**Weather_Shield_Weather_Sattion** This is a more advanced example of how to utilize every aspect of the weather shield. See the basic example if you're just getting started. This code reads all the various sensors (wind speed, direction, rain gauge, humidty, pressure, light, batt_lvl) and reports it over the serial comm port. This can be easily routed to an datalogger (such as OpenLog) or a wireless transmitter (such as Electric Imp). Measurements are reported once a second but windspeed and rain gauge are tied to interrupts that are calcualted at each report. This example code assumes the GPS module is not used. (*2)

**Weather_Shield_Weather_Sattion_(Adapted)** The same example but with the correct changes to run well with the final connections.

**LoRa_Weather_Shield_Weather_Station** Implementation of LoRa communication in the “Weather_Shield_Weather_Sattion.ino” code.

**LoRa_LowPower_Weather_Shield_Weather_Station** Implementation of LowPower library from RocketScream to the “LoRa_Weather_Shield_Weather_Station.ino” code. (*3)
